# Firuta - WEF filter collection for DFIR

Even though there are a lot of amazing solutions for Security Monitoring, 
it sometimes can be challenging to deploy / make use of them in an incident response
scenario for multiple reasons.

Windows Event Forwarding is free, available, easy to deploy (beside scaling Collectors),
encrypted by default and provides a good foundation for basic Security Monitoring, 
especially if combined with Sysmon.

This repository contains collection of XPath filters for Windows Event Forwarding to detect possible badness
I compiled from multiple sources.

Feedback is very welcome! :-)
